# Louis Tomlinson – Habit

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I always said that
I'd mess up eventually
I told you that,
so what did you expect from me?
It shouldn't come as no surprise
at all
I know you said that
you'd give me another chance
But you and I knew
the truth of it in advance
That mentally you were already
out the door
Never thought that giving up
would be so hard
But God, I'm missing you
and your addictive heart
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the feeling
I can't put down
You're the shiver
that I can't shake
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the high I need right now
You're the habit
that I can't break
I took some time
'cause I've ran out of energy
Of playing someone I've heard
I'm supposed to be
But honestly,
I don't have to choose anymore
And it's been ages,
different stages
Come so far from Princess Park
I'll always need you
In front of me, in front of me
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the feeling
I can't put down
You're the shiver
that I can't shake
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the high
that I need right now
You're the habit
that I can't break
You gave me the time
and the space
I was out of control
And I'm sorry I let you down
Guess that I know
what I already knew
I was better with you
And I miss you now
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the feeling
I can't put down
You're the shiver
that I can't shake
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the high
that I need right now
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the feeling
I can't put down
You're the shiver
that I can't shake
You're the habit
that I can't break
You're the high
that I need right now
You're the habit
that I can't break
