Never in the corner, luck of life
See/ Up/ Higher, never in style
I've a habit in life, keeping wild at reach
Gonna turn me into the type
Shadow's light never eats
Flic flac you're a habit to me
Flic flac you're a habit to me
I've got space in the light of lime
A nod to me, A nod to time
I've got space in the light of lime
A nod to me, A nod to time
Exhausting out in the arch of night
Farway/ Out/ you're going to see
I'm a loss of faith, you're a changed belief
Scored the goods for my baby, it's enough
So we hurry to leave
Flic flac you're a habit to me
Flic flac you're a habit to beat
I've got space in the light of lime
A nod to me, A nod to time
I've got space in the light of lime
A nod to me, A nod to time
I've got space in the light of lime
A nod to me, A nod to time
