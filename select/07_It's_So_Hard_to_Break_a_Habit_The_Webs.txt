It's so hard (La la la la la)
To break a habit
(Ooh)
It's so hard
(La la la la la)
To break a habit
(Ooh)
Girl I miss calling you on the phone
I miss holding you my darling in my arms
Ohhhh what do I do? What do I do?
I'm lost without you
And girl it's so hard (la la la la
La) to break a habit. (ohhhhh oohhh)
Now that you're gone (doo doo doo doo doo)
Girl I have to step down from my throne (doo doo doo doo doo)
You left me broken-hearted
I'm like a child without a home (child without a home)
And oooh I know I know
All the pretty things that come and go
But the memories of you will last I know
Ohhhh, its over now, (it's all over) we're through
So believe me when I tell you girl it's so hard
La la la la la, to break a habit, oh
(Oh I cant get over losing you)
