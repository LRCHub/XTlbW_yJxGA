[00:31.87] Hey man, you know
[00:33.75] I'm really okay
[00:39.09] The gun in my hand
[00:41.18] Will tell you the same
[00:46.63] But when I'm in my car
[00:48.76] Don't give me no crap
[00:50.40] 'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap it all
[01:17.90] 
[01:01.57] When I go driving, I stay in my lane
[01:07.88] But getting cut off, it makes me insane
[01:14.51] Open the glove box
[01:16.08] Reach inside
[01:17.40] Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
[01:32.40] 
[01:19.75] 'Cause I got a bad habit
[01:23.04] Of blowin' away (yeah, yeah)
[01:26.65] I got a bad habit (yeah, yeah)
[01:29.67] And it ain't goin' away (yeah, yeah)
[01:32.87] Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
[01:35.94] Yeah, yeah, oh
[01:42.94] 
[01:49.37] They say the road's a dangerous place
[01:55.67] If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
[02:02.08] You drive on my ass
[02:03.53] Your foot's on the gas
[02:05.23] And your next breath is your last
[02:21.73] 
[02:07.48] 'Cause I got a bad habit
[02:10.86] Of blowin' away (yeah, yeah)
[02:14.42] I got a bad habit (yeah, yeah)
[02:17.47] And it ain't goin' away (yeah, yeah)
[02:20.82] Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
[02:24.07] Yeah, yeah, oh
[02:31.07] 
[02:30.80] Drivers are rude
[02:32.37] Such attitudes
[02:34.23] When I show my piece
[02:36.86] Complaints cease
[02:38.06] Something's odd
[02:39.31] Feel like I'm God
[02:41.09] You stupid dumb-shit goddamn motherfucker!
[03:02.09] 
[02:57.23] I open the glove box
[02:58.92] Reach inside
[03:00.07] Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
[03:15.07] 
[03:02.63] 'Cause I got a bad habit
[03:05.74] Of blowin' away (yeah, yeah)
[03:09.45] I got a bad habit (yeah, yeah)
[03:12.44] And it ain't goin' away (yeah, yeah)
[03:15.69] Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
[03:27.19] 
[03:18.70] Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
